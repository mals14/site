Murren biking sounds other worldly!
The water powered mill is phenomenal to see.
The lift and the gandola - also very interesting.
Also, the cheese farm is very interesting if it can be seen.
Food will be, I suspect, a serious problem. But I am sure even that has been addressed by people.
Traditional music - interesting but may not be so for all, and I am not sure if every one will enjoy it.

Interlaken not too bad to see again. Esp. with some history background.

Military installations underground. Interesting. 15k buildings with hidden guns - wow.

Jungfraujoch train - yellow one. He is on the first train. Kliene Sheidig - rail junction at the base of the peak.

The train tunnels through the mountain. They dug it 100 years ago. 11k feet - the train takes you. Need a jacket for visiting this place. We have been here I suppose. **Go to the hut up above?**
